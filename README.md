# Reproducible-Pipeline-for-Differential-Expression-Analysis
This repository contains a reproducible RMarkdown pipeline for performing differential gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq data from the mouse hippocampus. The analysis is a practice exercise and is not intended to produce biologically significant results. It includes:

Data preprocessing and quality assessment (FastQC, Salmon)

Differential expression analysis using DESeq2

Exploratory data analysis (PCA, heatmaps)

Gene annotation using biomaRt and AnnotationHub

Functional enrichment analysis (GSEA, GO)

The workflow is designed to be fully reproducible and is suitable for training purposes.
